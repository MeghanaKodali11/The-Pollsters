RT @DonaldJTrumpJr: Good thread. https://t.co/iqk3azVPFa
BOTTOM LINE:  While @realDonaldTrump and his administration have been focused on protecting YOU, Democrats in Congress have been focused on attacking HIM! (8/8)
MAR 2:  The Trump administration secured commitments from top pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine to fight coronavirus.  Democrats began "quietly discussing moving ahead with punishments for individuals who defied subpoenas" in the impeachment sham. (7/8)
FEB 24:  @realDonaldTrump requested additional funding to fight the coronavirus.  Democrat Jerry Nadler demanded more documents from AG Barr to continue his political vendetta against the Trump administration. (6/8)
FEB 9:  The Trump administration’s Coronavirus Task Force met with governors to coordinate response efforts.  Chuck Schumer was busy soliciting inspectors general to open NEW investigations into @realDonaldTrump. (5/8)
JAN 31:  @realDonaldTrump initiated travel restrictions from China, which the experts have praised as a critical decision to slow the spread of coronavirus.  Democrat leaders called him “xenophobic” and “racist.” (4/8)
JAN 27: A tale of 2 press conferences.  @Mike_Pence outlined the administration's efforts to work with China to counter coronavirus.  Chuck Schumer demanded that more time be wasted with new impeachment witnesses. (3/8)
JAN 21:  The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to confront coronavirus.  What were Congressional Democrats focused on?  Writing their opening arguments for their bogus impeachment trial. (2/8)
THREAD.  Since Democrats in Congress keep attacking @realDonaldTrump, let's compare records.  JAN 7:  CDC established a coronavirus incident management system, two days before China announced the outbreak.  Pelosi began Week 3 of withholding her sham impeachment articles. (1/8)
In ID, @realDonaldTrump nearly DOUBLED (110,453) his own vote total from 2016 (62,413).  In MS, with 98% Reporting, @realDonaldTrump (234,289) received over DOUBLE the votes President Obama (97,304) received in 2012.  Dems simply cannot replicate this enthusiasm!
With 100% Reporting in Missouri, @realDonaldTrump (299K) received over FOUR TIMES the number of votes President Obama (64K) received in 2012, and over DOUBLE the number of votes President Bush (117K) received in 2004.   The enthusiasm is with Trump!

Michigan helped put @realDonaldTrump over the top in 2016, and we are seeing record-breaking enthusiasm for him tonight, as well.  With just 57% Reporting, President Trump (436,557) has already blown past President Obama's vote total (348,488) from 2012!
Congratulations @realDonaldTrump on winning the MICHIGAN primary!  For years, I watched the Democrat Party fail my state.  @realDonaldTrump came here with a message that resonated.  He has delivered on his promises and will win it again in 2020!
It does not matter which career politician Democrats nominate.  @realDonaldTrump just scored big wins in MISSOURI and MISSISSIPPI — and his millions of supporters are fired up for November!

80% of ingredients used to make American drugs are from overseas. Most of that comes from China. Time for the US to realize the importance of becoming self reliant when it comes to necessities like these.

The left adopted the “Medicare for All” terminology deliberately – because “socialized medicine” and “single-payer health care” were so unpopular. It was a marketing trick designed to dupe the public. Just like the broken promises that led to Obamacare. @standamericanow
Most Medicare for All supporters don’t realize that Medicare for All would abolish private insurance plans.   A whopping 67% of supporters think they will get to keep their health care plans (SPOILER ALERT: They won’t).  @standamericanow
China’s censorship isn’t limited to its latest health care crisis. Last week, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters as payback for an unfavorable opinion piece in the paper’s editorial section.
The Chinese govt continues to suppress criticism of its handling of the crisis.Journalists &amp; dissidents have disappeared without a trace; social media accounts have shut down without explanation; &amp; the world has no idea if the numbers released by China resemble reality.
