The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt.
We will continue to monitor the situation and work with the state parties to allow for flexibility around how states elect their delegates to the national convention once delegates are allocated based on primary or caucus results.
States need to adopt critical vote by mail safeguards to protect the right to vote for all voters: https://t.co/KEYqTRmHE4
In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the @DNC are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.
As we all deal with the uncertainty of #COVID19, it is *critical* that states provide clarity about upcoming primaries and caucuses. States can provide easy access to voting while protecting the health and safety of the American people.

Happy #SuperTuesday — polls have started to open! Find your polling location and hours at https://t.co/ZKn8fJEh9z and if you have any issues call our Voter Protection Hotline at 833-336-VOTE (8683).As the coronavirus continues to impact families across the country, I know how difficult this time is. But I’ve also been inspired by all the stories I’ve seen about neighbors helping neighbors and communities uplifting one another. Together, we can get through this.
"We cannot respond to this with a Band-Aid. It cannot be a bailout package and we keep on going the way that we did before. We need to respond with permanent systems and structures so that we do not find ourselves in this fragile of a position again." https://t.co/4dKehBoYim
Those experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of infection because they often live in congregated communities, cannot quarantine, &amp; often lack access to running water and other methods to prevent infection. We must increase homelessness assistance. https://t.co/sJkPQPA94t
Now seems like a great time for #MedicareForAll.
Important update! The tax filing deadline has been moved to July 15th to give families a break during this difficult time. https://t.co/lNxNAMB7YY
The coronavirus outbreak is as much a public health crisis as it is an economic one. No one should go into financial ruin because of this emergency.  https://t.co/JErsuyG2pm
Yes, it very much is racist.   Donald Trump is failing when Americans need a leader most. Shameful.  https://t.co/DI3EaHEnoi
We all must do our part to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Please visit the CDC’s website for guidelines: https://t.co/yu2Vwh0wyw
In light of the coronavirus, the Small Business Administration is providing Economic Injury Disaster Loans to help small business owners pay employees, debts, or pay off loans as a result of this pandemic. Visit their website to apply: https://t.co/lp6ypDZ4Q6
A dog named Wyatt, a pie-baking marathon, and shared music online. Find some happiness and hope during these tough times: https://t.co/UdBr3yEdgJ
Today and every day, I’m thankful for those who risk their own health and safety for that of others. To all the doctors, nurses, EMTs, paramedics, first responders, volunteers and everyone working on the frontlines of this epidemic, thank you.
This pandemic is hard on everyone, but some more than others. We must prioritize our students, especially those in the LGBTQ community, and ensure they have stable homes, food on the table, and the support system they need during this difficult time.  https://t.co/f14ZYthwsO
As more social distancing and quarantine policies are enacted, we cannot forget about those experiencing homelessness. I’m proud Oakland is working to protect EVERYONE in our communities.  https://t.co/FbegAGpk8t
I’m working hard in Congress to deliver the relief that Americans deserve right now. But in the meantime, please practice social distancing if you can. It’s on us to stop the spread of this virus. Here are some helpful tips: https://t.co/kZVlEHNup8
There is a public health emergency across our country and the Trump administration wants to further terrorize and destabilize our communities?   ICE has no place during this crisis. Period.  https://t.co/deck7zxQTf
Make no mistake: the Coronavirus will not affect everyone equally. Low-income workers, un- or under-insured people, those without stable housing, and undocumented communities will bear the brunt of this crisis.   We must build an economy that works for all in times of emergency.
Amid all the chaos, we cannot forget that the 2020 Census is up and running! Every single person needs to be counted. Get counted at https://t.co/4aGNNMb8CD
Happy St. Patrick’s Day everyone! 🍀  If you can, consider ordering take out (not dining in) from a local Irish business in your community. We could all use a helping hand during these difficult times.
COVID-19 is affecting all of us, especially small businesses and low-income communities. If you can, consider helping out one of these local Bay Area nonprofits:  https://t.co/gPicLAygRF
Stop this! Hoarding important items like this just prevents others from getting the supplies they need.  https://t.co/jftLShdXBG
😷 Always cover your cough or sneeze.  🧽 Disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (phones, laptops, remote controls, door knobs, and light switches come to mind).  ❤️ Take care of yourself and your family.
As Coronavirus spreads, here are some important things you should do:  👏 Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (that’s two rounds of Happy Birthday).  🙅🏿‍♀️ Don’t touch your face! I know it’s hard, but keep unwashed hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Taking food out of the mouths of hungry people during a global public health crisis is just plain cruel.   Glad that we blocked Trump’s dangerous SNAP cuts during the #coronavirus outbreak. https://t.co/jaelVsVQVG
This is a hard time for many, especially low-income communities. If you can, please consider donating to the Alameda County Food Bank: https://t.co/F9FJaPMJcT
🗣️Once more for the people in the back: Trump does NOT have Congressional authority to go to war with Iran.  https://t.co/UnkUY2Je44
When asked how many women will be enough on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg always said, "nine."  "People are shocked. But there’d been nine men, and nobody’s ever raised a question about that."  Happy Birthday, RBG!
This is a step in the right direction, but still not enough. Families shouldn’t have to choose between paying rent, putting food on the table, or paying their medical bills during a public health crisis. https://t.co/oZE0DWwdAO
While American families are struggling during a pandemic, 40 GOP House members voted AGAINST the #FamiliesFirstAct. Is your representative on this list? Make sure you call them to let them know how disappointed you are.  https://t.co/MIfJjlEEO1
THIS is what the GOP was fighting against in the #FamiliesFirstAct:  — Expanding unemployment benefits — Expanding SNAP, WIC and child nutrition benefits — Expanding emergency funds for Medicaid — Expanding aid to hospital workers
Proud to pass the #FamiliesFirstAct to give Americans the relief and support they deserve during this critical time. While we didn’t pass everything we wanted (full paid sick leave), I have no doubt this will help communities nationwide. https://t.co/quCAm55o7S
Let’s not forget that marginalized communities are much more vulnerable to #COVID-19. Low-income communities might not have access to high quality health care or can’t afford to take off work.  First step: universal paid sick leave.
Americans don’t want another war.  Trump’s continuous and reckless military actions, without Congressional approval or authorization, caused this crisis.  We must return to diplomacy, repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, and stop endless war. https://t.co/1KxcQ44ren
Trump’s failed leadership has very real life-or-death consequences for everyday families. Despite a pandemic, Trump is blocking low-income people from getting health care coverage. It’s outrageous.  https://t.co/3JlEcIbuPY
Make no mistake: people will die because of Trump's white nationalist policies. https://t.co/xA0lV3Otfv
Thoughts and prayers won’t solve issues like gun violence, climate change, and global pandemics. We need real action. Now.
It’s crucial that we take proper precautions to address the #COVID-19 outbreak, but we cannot forget how actions like college closures affect students. Now, more than ever, we must support low-income students who rely on schools for housing, food, &amp; income.https://t.co/OADT9LWRZO
It’s not up for discussion — there is no excuse for xenophobia and racism. https://t.co/V0NgmhYpRG
Together, we can turn our Progressive agenda into a reality and build an America that works for everyone.
I’m proud of House Democrats for acting quickly in the wake of the #COVID-19 outbreak.   Our bill will expand: — free coronavirus testing — paid sick leave — unemployment benefits — SNAP food assistance
Climate change is real. We need a #GreenNewDeal. It’s as simple as that.
Every American deserves paid sick leave.
There would be no Democratic Party without African American women. It’s time we have one as our Vice President.
We need a $15 minimum wage.
The attacks keep coming, so we’ll keep fighting. Read more about my ongoing fight for reproductive freedom for all: https://t.co/lsUDWufBWr
Voter suppression is real. And voter suppression is rampant. https://t.co/SPBl2yMzEq
It’s been 45 years since thousands of Southeast Asian refugees settled in this nation. Today, nearly 20% of this group lives in poverty. We must do better to support refugees and give them the tools to succeed in America.https://t.co/7aQtaP2qXr
We knew it before and we know it now: William Barr and the entire Trump administration have been lurking in the shadows and misleading the public. It’s disgraceful. We deserve the truth.https://t.co/8gCejXMV6I
We are working hard to rescue travelers stranded on the #GrandPrincess while maintaining the safety of our Oakland community and the general public. #COVID19 https://t.co/BaFSUHsLho
I believe in: — Health care as a human right — Climate action — The power of a living wage — Accessible education for all  — Equality and justice  If you’re with me, then we’re in this fight together.
Insurance companies shouldn’t make a profit from sick people. That’s why we need #MedicareForAll.
Happy Holi to all of our friends celebrating! May the festival of colors spread joy, peace, and happiness around the world.
It's been one year since the House passed the #ForThePeopleAct, which would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, &amp; reduce money in politics.   It's been sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk ever since because he refuses to hold a vote in the Senate. It’s time to change that.

“If they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.” — Shirley Chisholm   #InternationalWomensDay
We are working with state and local officials and doing our best to keep our community safe. Passengers on the #GrandPrincess will disembark into the Port of Oakland, but will not be released into the general public. More to come.
This is not only a waste of taxpayer dollars, it’s a flagrant violation of human rights. It’s past time to pass fair, common-sense immigration reform.https://t.co/yjFFflp1lA
Companies shouldn’t be profiting off marijuana when there are thousands of African Americans disproportionately behind bars for nonviolent drug crimes. Point blank. https://t.co/50wQZIznbi
Women are stronger when we build each other up, celebrate our strengths, and learn from our differences. I know I’m not alone in saying I wouldn’t be where I am today without the support, wisdom, and generosity of countless women. #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/paZTZ6UU3K
In a 24 hour news cycle, we cannot forget what we’re fighting for — Medicare for All, reproductive freedom, climate action, and justice for all.
Many industrialized countries around the world have a mandatory paid sick leave policy. It’s time for the U.S. to follow suit, especially considering the coronavirus outbreak will disproportionately affect low-wage workers. https://t.co/SnsOuBjpXB
Housing is a human right. Pass it on.
The narrative that somehow women are less electable than men seems to still be an issue. It’s very disgusting really.   Women are electable when we vote for them.
On this day, 55 years ago, police attacked protesters marching from Selma to Montgomery. Thank you to @repjohnlewis &amp; other civil rights activists who risked their lives for African Americans’ right to vote. We’ve come a long way, but the fight for freedom &amp; justice is not over. https://t.co/yRKJTz5WJI
Let’s be clear: the climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes. We cannot wait any longer to act.
Alameda County just passed a half-cent sales tax to increase pay for pediatric healthcare workers, raise childcare wages, &amp; subsidize preschool for low-income kids.   This is the kind of action we need to ensure that every child has the chance to succeed. https://t.co/SPDqFZyK4B
Every person has the right to a quality education. Full stop.
Stay up to date on the latest Coronavirus news by following @CDCgov and reading their helpful resources about how to stay healthy. Remember — washing your hands is always the best form of prevention.https://t.co/yu2Vwh0wyw
Don’t be fooled. The Trump administration is trying to redefine the poverty line so less people qualify for government assistance. This is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever struggled just to make ends meet.https://t.co/scc4iG9ZWg
RT if you’re proudly pro-choice.
Betsy DeVos is failing our students by cutting thousands of dollars in aid for some of the poorest, most rural districts in the country. All of our children deserve an equal chance at success, but DeVos only cares about pleasing her wealthy friends.  https://t.co/gDSi2tR2Hp
There is nothing more fundamentally American than fighting for your rights. I stand with every worker across the country fighting to improve their wages. It’s time Congress #RaiseTheWage! https://t.co/2ba9we8oOH
Trump’s xenophobic border wall is a waste of taxpayer dollars. The presidency is not a dictatorship — you better believe California is fighting back.  https://t.co/9mdmkRUu5a
Abortion is health care. No matter what the Trump Administration and right-wing Supreme Court throws our way, I will never stop fighting for the basic right of controlling your own body.
When someone working 40 hours a week cannot afford basic needs like housing, health care, and food — our system has failed.   We must come together to create an economy where the minimum wage is a living wage.
Mike Pence failed Indiana and contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in the state’s history. He has no business leading a national effort to protect our public health.  https://t.co/ZLENJKbjzo
Let this sink in — the Trump administration is deliberately lying to the American people about the severity of climate change because otherwise it would affect their wealthy friends’ profits. It's outrageous. https://t.co/rvQwLKltb6
If Betsy DeVos actually cared about our students — she would resign immediately.   DeVos has repeatedly abused her power and sided with her wealthy friends. She has no place advocating for our children. https://t.co/zdjwoePDGu

This is outrageous. Seeking asylum is a human right, but the Trump administration wants to slap a price tag on it. We cannot look away from these gross injustices.  https://t.co/x88T9fmP88
"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it."  Excited to welcome these high schoolers as we make the annual pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama to visit some of the most pivotal locations in Civil Rights history. https://t.co/Ey4j1VkrBV
As we close out #BlackHistoryMonth, let’s remember that Black history is American history. From the medical industry to the arts, and everything in between, the contributions made my African Americans should be celebrated every month.
I cannot believe the sheer amount of ignorance that comes with saying impoverished Americans live very well.   This is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever struggled to get by.  https://t.co/eBzDKvjRiK
Over and over again, Congress asks Betsy DeVos for reports on why Black and Latino children are punished more than white students. But it's clear she doesn't care about stopping these babies from being punished.  It’s time for her to go. https://t.co/lDdZkhSxcq
Betsy DeVos has spent her entire career doing nothing but hurting students of color, low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who’ve experienced sexual assault.  She must be stopped.
James Baldwin pushed boundaries by exploring race and social issues in his literary works. Often writing about the African American experience in America, he became an important voice and precursor to the Civil Rights Movement. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/mg3qTcy2or

Poverty is one of the single greatest threats to a person’s well-being. Every institution, from the White House to Congress to the courts, should work to ensure our rights to housing, a living wage, health care, and food are met no matter what. https://t.co/MruUHeJ5OC
This makes me sick to my stomach. These Republican tactics are nothing but intimidation and dirty tricks.  The purpose of the census is to get a full and accurate count of the U.S. population. Every person must be counted without stigma or fear. https://t.co/Zow6M395ve
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: lawmakers who are willing to trade the safety of our communities for cash from the gun lobby do not deserve the honor of serving in Congress.
Lynching is a hateful and horrendous part of our nation’s history.   This bill is long overdue.  https://t.co/r6c6XAMUlE
We must end this horrendous violence against people of color.

Current homeless shelters are often too crowded and unstable for those needing a place to sleep. We should be ashamed — this is not how we take care of our most vulnerable communities.   The solution? Make housing affordable and wages livable.  https://t.co/NKEYMYcCQf

Slavery is a stain on our nation's history. For centuries, African Americans were unpaid for their labor and unable to create generational wealth within their families. That's why I support reparations for those who have been and continue to be wronged by our country’s past.

When our country only works for the top 1% and special interests are allowed to buy influence in our government — it’s time to change the system.  Democrats are fighting to make everyday families a priority, while Washington Republicans only care about their bottom line.
The Trump administration needs to be held accountable for their abusive anti-immigrant behavior. We cannot allow this administration to rewrite history.  https://t.co/2YVnmEKJAB
The Trump budget is downright dangerous for our communities. We need to take serious action on climate change immediately — not slash funding from critical climate science centers.  https://t.co/lJ5g95eQQt
Abortion bans are not based in science and are overwhelmingly unpopular. As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, you better believe I’m fighting against every attempt to limit women’s rights.

Russia interfered in our 2016 elections. Everyone — both Republicans and Democrats — must speak out against an attempt of the same interference in 2020. This is not partisan politics. This is a matter of national security. https://t.co/mgPNgErNVv

We already have the tools to treat HIV and achieve an AIDs-free generation. But stereotypes, discrimination, and lack of programs for the poor and rural communities prevent people most at-risk from receiving the treatment they need. https://t.co/xEO63gkuo9
Poverty is having to make tough, basic choices that most people take for granted. Do I buy diapers or dinner? How far can I stretch my medication? Do I pay my parking ticket or buy my son sneakers?  We must end poverty so that no family has to make these decisions.

As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, Thurgood Marshall’s words seem more poignant than ever, “We must dissent from the fear, the hatred, and the mistrust...because America can do better."  From abortion bans to the climate crisis to attacks on immigrants — we must do better.
Trump is trying to attack California’s critical ecosystems, deplete our natural resources, and harm our environment.   We won’t let him get away with it. https://t.co/LypS7fG0vN
I can’t believe this still needs to be said in 2020, but everyone deserves access to safe, affordable, and comprehensive reproductive health care — and that includes abortion.  No one should be forced to travel over 200 miles to receive a legal procedure.  https://t.co/PZ2dUx4CK6
We don’t talk about diaper need enough.   Nearly one-third of parents cannot afford regular baby diapers. My #EndDiaperNeed Act would create a $100 million fund for distributing free diapers to low-income families.
Gwen Ifill was a trailblazer for women of color in journalism. She was the first African American woman to moderate a vice presidential debate and her legacy lives on even today. Let’s honor her this month and every month. #BlackHistoryMonth  https://t.co/yKpikjId1r
Act on climate change. Act on climate change. Act on climate change. Act on climate change. Act on climate change.

On this day in 1942, the U.S. government authorized the internment of over 110,000 Japanese Americans.  Today, Trump is banning people from entering the U.S. from Muslim countries.  “Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.”
Democrats are doing everything we can to eliminate poverty and expand assistance programs, while Trump is threatening to cut food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, and more that millions of families rely on.   We will fight back.
Trump wants billions of dollars for an ineffective border wall in his new budget. Here are better uses of those taxpayer dollars: ✅Revitalizing our nation’s infrastructure ✅Investing in quality education ✅Implementing Medicare for All ✅Addressing affordable housing

During #BlackHistoryMonth, let's remind ourselves that the suffragette movement largely benefitted only white women. It wouldn't be until decades later that African American women were able to vote. And even today, suppression keeps them from the polls. https://t.co/qMog0NjpZK
Homelessness has risen for the third consecutive year. That’s unacceptable. We must get serious about tackling our nation’s affordable housing epidemic. Now.

It’s been two years since the shooting at Parkland. Gun violence is an American epidemic and Congress needs to do more than pause for another moment of silence.
Just weeks after the House passed my bill to repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF, the Senate passed a War Powers Resolution to curb Trump’s warmongering – but there’s still more work to be done.  I urge McConnell to bring my legislation to repeal the 2002 AUMF to a vote in the Senate.
Hi all, I’m Clyde (Barbara’s new husband) popping on here to say hi! And to wish a very Happy Valentine’s Day to the incredibly fierce leader I know as my wife. Here’s to a lifetime of love, happiness, and friendship. Love you, Barbara! https://t.co/DruO79e1qY
Two years ago today, Parkland suffered a tragedy no community should ever have to experience. 17 people died in a high school shooting.  Today, we mourn their deaths but honor their lives by committing to #EndGunViolence.
Poverty is the single greatest threat to children’s well-being. We must make ending poverty a national priority.
Trump’s budget would be disastrous for students. Here’s why:  ❌$6 billion cut from federal student loan programs in the 1st year ❌$170 billion in cuts by 2030 ❌Abolish the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program
This isn’t “overzealous.” This is institutionalized racism and xenophobia within our immigration system. Detaining people because of nationality is cruel, inhumane, and unjust.  https://t.co/XVMIG3reMG

🚨🚨🚨  Food is a basic human right but the #TrumpBudget would cut $182 billion from SNAP, jeopardizing families across the country.
A budget represents someone’s values. And it’s clear the #TrumpBudget is pushing a xenophobic, anti-immigrant, dangerous agenda that would cut housing, health care, and food stamps and harm families across the country. We cannot stand for this.  https://t.co/PrXO3ajS2q
Asian American and Pacific Islander women have to work this far into the year to earn the same amount that white men earned in 2019 alone. On #AAPIEqualPayDay, we must keep fighting to ensure #EqualPayForEqualWork.

In this country you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.   But nearly half a million people are sitting in jail tonight, not because they’re guilty of a crime — but because they can’t afford bail.  The cash bail system is cruel, unjust, and must end.
We cannot let ourselves forget Black Wall Street.  This self-sufficient African-American neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma was burned to the ground and at least 300 people were murdered in racist attacks. As painful as this history is, we must remember it. https://t.co/KUQTo552ou
While Democrats want to uplift democracy and expand voter access, Republicans are actively trying to keep low-income people, communities of color, and students from the polls.  https://t.co/k9x6JVlgdb

"You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I’ll rise."  Maya Angelou's famous words still ring true today — we will rise and fight for truth, justice, and equality. #BlackHistoryMonth
There is nothing more fundamentally American than fighting for your rights. We must protect workers’ rights to organize and improve the quality of life for themselves and their families. I’m proud to support the #PROAct to strengthen the power of all workers to join a union.
🗣️ The 2001 AUMF gives presidents blank checks for endless war. It’s got to go.
2 in 5 Americans can’t afford a $400 emergency. A parking ticket, medical bill, or home repair could leave someone broke and in mountains of debt. An unlivable minimum wage combined with rising housing costs are failing American families. https://t.co/DdsLk9yLjy
Student homelessness has more than doubled in 15 years due to racial wealth gaps, low minimum wages, affordable housing shortages, and even climate change causing devastating natural disasters.  Our kids deserve better. We must act. https://t.co/LawxpI6KGo
The Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies are killing people. We should all be ashamed.  https://t.co/p30juyffMv
Today is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects communities of color and if we’re serious about ending this epidemic, then we need to address the treatment and prevention inequality perpetuated by institutionalized discrimination.
Too many families have to choose between paying the bills or putting food on the table. Instead of helping to expand assistance for those living in poverty, the GOP wants to kick millions off basic programs like Social Security and food stamps. It’s shameful.
“We won’t die from old age, we’ll die from climate change.” “Why should I study for a future I won’t have?”  “Why should I be in school if the world is burning?”  The climate crisis is robbing a generation of their future. We must act.  https://t.co/u4jcsSROBf
If Trump really cared about communities of color, he would uplift policies like affordable housing, a living wage, and quality health care.  But until then, he’s paying lip service and hoping you won’t notice.  https://t.co/8laXIwraWj
This is long overdue and sadly, still out of reach for many members of the LGBTQ community. It’s time we stop criminalizing and stigmatizing people for who they love.  https://t.co/L1R8B4DUyj
Affordable housing. A living wage. Food on the table.   Make no mistake: these are basic human rights.
FACT CHECK: Trump is attacking poor people — not poverty. His policies have ripped families off of welfare, denied them food stamps, and deepened the racial wealth gap.  https://t.co/RhkbStO1vk
In the richest nation on Earth, no child should be left without a home — but the number of homeless students is drastically rising. 1️⃣ We must make significant investments to end the affordable housing crisis. 2️⃣ We must make the minimum wage a living wage https://t.co/HfiAATFeIN
Yesterday, Senate Republicans proved that they’re too weak to stand up for what’s right. Let’s make sure they’re out of a job come November.
In the face of Trump and a dysfunctional Republican party, we can and must elect Democrats up and down the ballot. This is our chance to put our country back in the hands of qualified, compassionate public servants. We can’t afford to miss it.
Today would have been Trayvon Martin’s 25th birthday. My prayers are with his family, but actions are just as important — we must keep fighting against inequality and injustice in our country.
The Republican-led Senate just acquitted Trump of all impeachment charges.  It’s clear Trump abused his office for his own political gain. But Mitch McConnell and his rank-and-file yes-men pushed through a sham of a trial to protect the president at all costs.

If we want to live in a society that is just and equal, when we say "if you are sick, stay home" we need to equip all working Americans with the ability to do so.
Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Americans should not have to sacrifice their health to put food on the table. With the ideas of isolation luring over communities across the country, that's just simply not a choice for impoverished and working-class families.
This legislation, if passed, would give 14 paid sick days in public health emergencies like the one we are facing right now.   https://t.co/RYYyO5oWcc
In her op-ed, Sen. @PattyMurray writes "Here’s the problem: 32 million people in our country have no paid sick days. In other words, for one-in-four workers, taking one of the most impactful steps we can to combat the virus could mean losing a paycheck or potentially a job."
Sen. @PattyMurray writes this op-ed for Cosmopolitan Magazine to condemn the GOP and their efforts to block legislation that could help employees in the U.S. prioritize their health and well-being over concerns of financial hardship.

Strictly sheltering in place is one way we can all take care of each other during this uniquely stressful time. It's the least we can do for all of our brave healthcare workers, grocery store employees, and others who don't have the option to stay home. Be safe!
There is no reason to freak out, but we do need to take the shelter-in-place order seriously. If you don't need to, don't leave the house, unless you're going on a hike or a run. Being outside to get some fresh air is totally fine!
These jobs are also exempted from shelter in place: healthcare operations, grocery stores, food banks, convenience stores, gas stations and auto repair shops, banks, hardware stores, plumbers, electricians, laundromats, garbage collection. Full list HERE&gt;&gt; https://t.co/gaiJzRjpuY
Here are some essential tasks: caring for our seniors, minors, dependents, and people with disabilities; caring for a family member in another home; getting supplies like food and medicine; and going to the doctor.
It is *not* inherently dangerous to be outside. My sons will continue shooting hoops in the driveway, and my daughter Betsy and I will continue our outdoor yoga. We just need to stay at home unless it's *necessary* to leave.
I know the #Covid_19 news is overwhelming for many in our community, so I wanted to explain @GavinNewsom's statewide shelter-in-place order. The summary: it's not as scary as it sounds. Read this thread to learn more.
This is a difficult new reality for our state, but one that will undoubtedly save lives. Thankful for @GavinNewsom’s courage in these times. Wishing we had this kind of leadership in the White House. Learn more about the Governor's directive ⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/FfAuCizaaG

The #COVID_19 crisis highlights why we need comprehensive paid sick leave is. Nobody should go to work sick—putting other employees and the public at risk—because they won’t otherwise be able to put food on the table.  Read my op-ed with @RepMalinowski ⬇ https://t.co/p5WlYnnVjo

Our Congressional stimulus package ought to support families and small businesses. The @USChamber thinks it should be a boon to large corporations.  I'm standing up for working Americans and against this giveaway to special interests.
When it comes to social distancing and public health best practices, Congress should be an example, not an exception.  So @RepSwalwell, @RepVanTaylor, and I are leading a group of 50+ Reps. to call on leaders of both parties to allow remote voting, so we can keep doing our jobs. https://t.co/s9sGY3TMi9
People are concerned about paying their bills and staying safe during this pandemic—they shouldn’t also have to worry about companies profiting off their personal data.  @RepMalinowski and I are conducting oversight of the tech giant behind a new #Covid_19 triage website. https://t.co/OCdiwqA9Vr
And as a consumer advocate, I know how important it is for us to have accurate information, so I also asked Mr. Bezos to label the types of hand sanitizer (with lower than 60 percent alcohol content) that won’t be effective in killing the virus.
We all have a role to play in combating #Covid_19. @amazon has the capacity to save hundreds of thousands of lives by redeploying its vast resources creatively. I’m asking CEO @JeffBezos to redirect its stock of face masks and sanitizer to help hospitals fill shortages. https://t.co/Fjz90i7bKj
I worked on the foreclosure crisis and saw firsthand the need for a stimulus that helps working Americans. We need immediate relief, and that starts with sending all Americans $1,000. @SenatorRomney, let’s come together, across the aisle, and get this done. https://t.co/LzjAd4JlNK
My work in Congress wouldn't be possible without a dedicated staff. Behind every hearing is research, creativity, expertise, and hard work. During this crisis, even more than usual, we need committed public servants. I’m thankful for my entire team today and every day. https://t.co/75xmW3fyue
UPDATE: @JetBlue removed the ad and is now offering up to 14 days of paid leave for workers. I commend them for their efforts to support public health, but “up to” 14 days is vague.

For those who haven't been following along, I highlighted the issue with these census scams in a hearing with the Census Director last month and also called on him to do something about this. WATCH &gt;&gt; https://t.co/x6HXKYSYiP
While I'm disappointed this was even being done in the first place, I'm glad that @GOP has announced they'll stop the deceptive mailers. This is why I conduct aggressive oversight: to protect everyday Americans and our shared institutions like the census. https://t.co/Z4kdvFC7iY
Please keep in mind that unless you have severe symptoms, you should not go to the hospital or a doctor's office, as healthcare facilities are overwhelmed. If you have mild or moderate symptoms, self-quarantine for 14 days.
Yesterday, @CDCDirector committed to making #Covid_19 diagnostic tests free for everyone who needs them. Now he’s trying to break that promise, and I won’t allow it. So today, I called on @CDCGov to provide clarity and a recommitment.  More here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/oQ7lfXqJe7
The Administration isn’t acting with the urgency this issue deserves. So, I’m leading over 80 of my colleagues in calling on @US_FDA and @HHSGov to issue guidance allowing academic medical centers to support the rest of the medical community in preventing the spread of #Covid_19. https://t.co/2lFE6awV3d
I want to be clear. Medical professionals are advising that unless you have serious symptoms, avoid going to the hospital/doc’s office. Stay home. We don’t currently have the capacity to test healthy people, and going to the hospital puts people at risk. https://t.co/EdBqjlRLMT
This is a gross message to send, @JetBlue. The precautions the CDC is recommending, like teleworking and social distancing, will save lives, but not if abused by corporations looking to make a buck. This isn’t the time for jokes that downplay the seriousness of this pandemic. https://t.co/XZ8KvowoUT
I did the math: a full battery of coronavirus testing costs at minimum $1,331.  I also did the legal research: the Administration has the authority to make testing free for every American TODAY.  I secured a commitment from a high-level Trump official that they’d actually do it. https://t.co/RmolCtmNbG
These 2 @WellsFargo board members resigned before coming to our hearing today, but the remaining members have no business taking over the helm. I had a simple question for outgoing directors: is presiding over major scandals a qualification to be on the Wells Fargo board? https://t.co/jcFNJ6u1eX
In a hearing today, I asked why 1/3 of tellers rely on public assistance to make ends meet, when @WellsFargo made $20 billion in profit last year.  CEO Charlie Scharf apparently wasn't even sure the bank was profitable! He only said he "believes" it is. 👀 https://t.co/X7SW3eOaKH

Wishing a very bright and cheerful #Holi to all who are celebrating in Orange County and beyond! During the festival of colors, we celebrate the arrival of spring and the triumph of good over evil—it is so heartening to see such beautiful displays of festivity and joy.
This week, President Trump asked Congress, by tweet, to support the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am 100% behind this, but it seems the biggest roadblock to getting this done will be the President himself, as his 2021 budget cuts @EPA by 26% and slashes millions from LWCF. https://t.co/VBCB5WWsz8
Knowing if you have COVID-19 can help keep you, your family, and our community safe. We need to be equipped with the best tools and knowledge to fight this coronavirus, and the cost of diagnostic testing cannot be a barrier.
So I took action. Last night, I led an effort with @Rosa_DeLauro and @RepUnderwood to demand that the Administration take action to make these tests affordable for everyone, including those on private plans.  To learn more about our effort, read here: https://t.co/5FNgTbvYQA
I refuse to put patients’ health at risk so that insurance companies can use COVID-19 to pad their profits. Patients with private insurance shouldn’t have to choose between lab tests for this virus and putting food on the table.
The same day Administration officials briefed Congressmembers and told us that everyone who needs to can get tested for the coronavirus, we see news like this. So were we lied to, or does the Administration not understand the scope of what we’re dealing with? https://t.co/dI7XPeioc0
Now do fake political ads. https://t.co/AGm0zQqotS
I also backed $8.3 billion in emergency funding today to combat the spread of the coronavirus, which includes: ✅ $1 billion for medical supplies for providers, ✅ $3 billion for R&amp;D, ✅ $950 million for state agencies, and ✅ $300 million to increase vaccine affordability.
Orange County families want results, not rhetoric. So this afternoon, instead of listening to Vice President Pence talk about the Administration's failed attempts to stop the coronavirus, I held a call with OC hospital leaders on the frontlines of this fight. https://t.co/pIePuh4USp

@donmoyn I’ve read some articles citing your research—but this weekend, I’m reading your book. 📚📚  Hearings are to educate Congress, and when witnesses have no answers, I will keep working to understand problems and find solutions.
This week, we recognize National Gun Violence Survivors Week, because it’s about the time of year that gun deaths in the U.S. exceed the *yearly* total of our peer countries.  It’s past time for the Senate and the President to turn gun violence prevention legislation into law.
Our Founders envisioned the House as the chamber closest to the people. I have a duty to hold special interests and government officials accountable to everyday Americans. It's a responsibility I take seriously, and it's one of my top priorities in Congress. /end thread
Finally, I sat in on a @FSCDems Oversight Subcommittee hearing—even though I'm not on this subcommittee. I spotlighted an incident last year where a financial watchdog cited phony comments submitted to him to defend his rollback of shareholder protections. https://t.co/rN0KADwHSz
Then, I participated in a @FSCDems hearing with our nation's top consumer protection official. She's been emphasizing financial education for consumers instead of holding bad actors accountable. I questioned whether she was up to her own task. https://t.co/J99PEUfVOG

There's been a lot of chatter about what the President said in his wide-ranging #SOTU last night, but let's talk about what was left out.

The Admin’s expanded travel ban emphasizes what our communities already know—this ban has always been about prejudice and xenophobia. That’s why visitors are allowed but not permanent immigrants. I’m glad the House will soon consider legislation to end this discriminatory policy.
The first Social Security check was issued 80 years ago today. As the population of older adults grows, we can't abandon our commitment to their financial security. That's why I’ll keep fighting to protect Social Security for current and future generations.
We are closely monitoring the situation and will be updating this FAQ as more information is available. We’re also working on getting subsequent versions translated into the diversity of languages read and spoken in #CA45. Stay tuned.

Our Orange County office is currently seeking winter and spring interns! If you or someone you know is interested, please visit my website for more information. Priority will be given to those who apply before January 6. https://t.co/FKtGxPJmjB
I am so grateful to our interns Ali, Gabriella, Keely, Rana, and Sarah for their help in our Orange County office this fall and excited to see what these outstanding young people do next. https://t.co/3l0n2hDoWu
I'm humbled to be named one of Orange County's most influential people of 2019 and honored to share the list with outstanding pillars of our community, like Helen Nguyen, my guest to the State of the Union. In 2020, I will keep putting OC families first. https://t.co/y1hgELlJQG
Happy #Hanukkah to our Orange County families celebrating the Festival of Lights! I hope everyone is able to enjoy quality time with friends and family.
I always bring the receipts. #2019in5words https://t.co/zqabsLYZZ3
Orange County is home to vibrant communities of color—it's essential for districts like #CA45 that medical providers receive training to give the best possible care to patients, regardless of race, ethnicity, or primary language. Proud to work with my friend @RepDMP on this bill. https://t.co/ibsaeq2Gi8
Patients needing organ transplants don't have Ds or Rs next to their names. As I've done here, I'll work with anyone if it means improving healthcare and saving lives for Orange County families.
I’m pleased to see that the Administration listened to my call for critical oversight. This week, @CMSGov published a proposal that will go a long way to holding Organ Procurement Organizations accountable. I'll continue to work with the them as they finalize these protections.
Previously, I asked the Administration to implement clear reporting standards for Organ Procurement Organizations, which are responsible for evaluating &amp; procuring organs for transplant. Patients are dying because these organizations are underperforming.   https://t.co/JGNiLrlLbG
Today, there are over 113,000 patients in need of a lifesaving organ transplant. These patients are fighting for their lives, and unfortunately, they’re also battling a system that is stacked against them. (mini-thread)
High-cost lenders announced during their earnings calls that they planned to target CA borrowers with abusive loan terms banned in our state. Today, I’m forwarding transcripts of those calls to federal watchdogs. I won’t stand by while bad actors try to skirt our laws. https://t.co/4r89VGWmLO
Many of you have reached out to my office with questions about what happens now that the House has voted in favor of articles of impeachment. Here's a quick guide &gt;&gt; https://t.co/hUZ8KBr98r
Today is a good day for Orange County families. The House passed a bill I've been pushing that would lower taxes for OC residents and repeal the harmful State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap.  Hear me explain why this legislation is so important to our community ⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/enMfqSeLMX
RT @FSCDems: .@RepKatiePorter on @FSCDems 2019 in Review | https://t.co/FOjeyEu45m https://t.co/KcAnoXOIEP
I’m excited to join my first @OversightDems markup meeting this morning, where we’re discussing important legislation to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars; improve the security of federal technology; and more. https://t.co/jIutgtnYtu
RT @OversightDems: Welcome to the Committee, @RepDebHaaland and @RepKatiePorter! Together, we will continue to conduct rigorous oversight t…
The Administration is playing politics with people’s lives. We need to improve our healthcare system, but this is simply not the way to do it. I will continue fighting to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible for Orange County families. (6/6)
Now, regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision in June, Trump still doesn’t have an alternative plan to ensure Americans don’t lose healthcare coverage. This is the reason they were never able to repeal the law in the first place. (5/6)
This process is meant to undermine the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded coverage to millions of Americans despite its imperfections. After the Trump Administration failed to repeal and replace the law, they had to find another legal alternative to destroy it. (4/6)
At this time, the 5th Circuit Court decided that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. This may be appealed, and there may be a Supreme Court decision in the future, but for now, the lower courts will continue discussing the rest of the law. (3/6)
First, let’s be clear about one thing, the most important thing. The Affordable Care Act, with all its successes and flaws, is still the law of the land. You should still enroll in healthcare coverage. (2/6)
You might have missed it yesterday, but an appeals court issued a new decision regarding the Affordable Care Act. I want to take a minute to explain what the decision means for you and your healthcare. (THREAD) https://t.co/BWIt7lVPDv
Today is a solemn day for our country, but my oath to the Constitution leaves me no other choice. We must stand up for the rule of law, for our democracy, and for the people.
Earlier this month, I called on House leadership to prioritize a provision in our tax code that would lower families’ medical expenses and save them money. I’m pleased to share that this measure passed the House today and should be signed into law this week. #GettingThingsDone https://t.co/8W2PBG4xgN
I'm excited to announce that I'm joining @OversightDems. I've worked hard during my time in Congress to hold CEOs and top officials accountable to everyday Americans. I'll be using this new position to continue speaking up for working families. Stay tuned for updates.
